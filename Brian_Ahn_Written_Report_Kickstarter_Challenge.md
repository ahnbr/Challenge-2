# Kickstarting with Excel

Kickstarter Fundraising Analysis 

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to determine which months of the year have been the most successful to raise money via Kickstarter as well as determine the percentage of projects that successfully raised the money-raising goals based on the amount of money needed to be raised to fund the project.

### Purpose

In performing the analysis in this challenge, I created a pivot table and a pivot chart using the filters - Parent Category and Years, outcomes in columns and date created conversion in the rows. For the values, I used a count of outcomes to create a line graph with markers. Second, using the COUNTIFS command, I created a new sheet where the outcome of the projects as well as the percent that was successful, failed or canceled were determined based on a range of dollar values.  

## Analysis and Challenges

I had some difficulty using the COUNTIFS command in Excel and I still don't think it was done properly. I wasn't sure where my COMMAND went wrong but the final graph slightly resembled the one provided in the module challenge. The videos and hints provided were helpful but I still ran into some difficutly with it.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the Outcomes based on Launch date, the most successful time for fund raising is in May and the least successful time to launch a Kickstarter campaign is in October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

For outcomes based on Goals, the more money required to be raised shows a sharp increase in failed projects, especially once that fundraising goal exceeds $30,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some of the limitations of this dataset is that it doesn't necessarily account for external events or provide much insight as to why certain times of the year are better than others for crowdfunding. There also could be more information regarding the success and outcome of some of these plays to provide more reasoning as to why a particular project failed beyond time of year or money. In other words, there is no way to judge the quality of the project itself outside of the blurb. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

There could be a pie chart to easily show how many of the total projects were successful, failed or canceled as a quick visualization. It would also be interesting to see the correlation between successful fundraising based on the subcategory according to countries to see and try to determine if such a relationship exists and certain types of entertainment are more successful than others based on the location.
